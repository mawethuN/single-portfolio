          <div className="column">
            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
            <p>
              Art as a form is a very broad and quite controversial topic to define and discuss. Throughout the ages, art has changed its form on many occasions, art has become a very transformative tool used and interpreted by whomever is creating it for display. Although art is subjective in whatever form you deem it to be, art is very much a form that rivals technology in the sense of changing rapidly to adapt new forms and changing the culture of creating art works. Technology is innovation, the internet is the embodiment of change, everything is about transforming and evolving. The same thing could be said for art. But what happens when these two forms collide?
            </p>
            <p>
              In this essay I will provide a critical examination of Net/Web Art, and the progression it has made over the years. To discuss this topic, I will use the readings provided by the course along with additional YouTube videos, links to articles and websites that display and discuss Web Art of artists. This essay will define what web/net art is, where and how it has progressed throughout the ages, and possible turns it may take to the future. This will be followed by a swift conclusion that will summarise everything discussed in this essay.
            </p>
            <h3>HISTORICAL CONTEXT: WHERE DID THIS COME FROM?</h3>
            <p>
              I’m sure the question surrounding this is “How did this come to be?”. What really is net/web art, and where does it come from. In this course, the course definition of Net art is art that takes inspiration from the internet, or art that was designed and made for the consumption of the internet. Danae states that Net Art is a an online culture phenomenon that rapidly changes (Danea, 2019). She states that through the use of social media, The internet allows artists and viewers to be everywhere at once. By everywhere she means across multiple social media platforms creating art that is best suited for the culture of each social media outlet (Danae, 2019). 
            </p>
            <p>
              Now to answer the following… where does it come from? Well according to Walkden, the early traces of internet art trace back to the 1990s. During this time, the internet was relatively young and there was still room for interpretation. The concept of Net Art was being fleshed out and was explored as a tool to discover identity and representation. The 1990s to the 2000s were a period where the primary objective was to share as much art online as possible. Distribution of art became a norm and finding new ways of sharing art became the thing that most probably led to a wide boom in the email and social media creation.
            </p>
            <h3>TRADITIONAL AND ONLINE</h3>
            <p>
              When we think about art, the first thing that comes to mind is traditional art forms. You think of paintings and sketches or sculptures, you don’t necessarily think of the logo that pops up on an ad, or the website that showcases the use of data repurposed as an image or a map. Over time there has been a gradual shift in this way of thinking. A main contributor to this was surprisingly the 2020 pandemic. Carrier states that the 2020 pandemic was a main contributor to the migration of traditional works to online museums (Carrier,2020). An example of this that I have found was the google collaboration with the Louvre Museum. This project saw the digitalising of many famous paintings that could be enjoyed from the comfort of your own home. The digital art gallery saw a shift that changed the course of the internet art world. Carrier also stated that this great migration is similar to the one that happened centuries earlier, whereby art works were taken out from churches and Vatican to be displayed in Art museums for the people to enjoy (Carrier,2020).
            </p>
            <p>
              Carrier states that Internet Art could be classified as Wild Art. Wild Art is described as being Art that falls outside the traditional art descriptions (Carrier,2020). Internet Art is described as not sharing the basic rules of traditional Art, making it a variant that is not necessarily welcomed or recognised within the traditional art space. Regrardless, it is considered as one of the most progressive and inclusive art forms of this century.

            <h3>CASE STUDY</h3>
            <p>
              Some of the earliest contributors to internet art are Olia Liania from Russia and JODI, a pair consisting of Joan Heemshkerk from the Netherlands and Dirk Paesmans from Belgium. These individuals were present during the experimental age of internet art in the mid 1990's. Olia Lialina created an interactive narrative project titled 'My Boyfriend Came Back from the War' in 1996 (Welcome to the Museum, 2019). The narrative is seemingly simplistic yet holds some emotional weight to it, you converse with a young man who recently came back from a war, the conversation has no positive resolutions no matter the outcome. It gives of a sense of hopelessness for your efforts. The project was created in the mid 1990’s, this resulted in he project having that 90’s slow internet feel to it and was maintained to this day to still give off that feeling. The website is intentionally programmed to load slower to maintain this feeling.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1995, the JODI pair launched a labyrinth of a website that generates varying pages filled with random interactable visuals and text that generate new experiences upon interaction. Their website is titled wwwwwwwww.jodi.org (Welcome to the Museum, 2019).

            <h3>AI Art: The Machine as Artist</h3>
            <p>
              AI art, internet art, and UI/UX design are all fast-changing fields that mix art and technology in exciting ways. This essay looks at what makes each field unique and important, using recent research and adding my own thoughts on where these areas are headed. AI art is where technology meets creativity, making us rethink what it means to be an artist. This mix has been around since the 1960s, with things like the journal Leonardo and Jack Burnham’s book Beyond Modern Sculpture. Today, AI isn’t just a tool for artists; it’s becoming an artist itself.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Kinetic or Robotic Art: These artworks move and act like performance art, showing how machines can interact with people in creative ways. It's honestly amusing to see robots performing and making people feel something. This shows how far we've come in making machines that can connect with us emotionally.
              </li>
              <li>
                Algorithmic Studio Assistants: These systems help make art using algorithms, like digital paintings or sculptures. Having an algorithm as a studio assistant is fascinating. It democratizes art creation, making art creation possible for more people, which can lead to a more diverse art community.
              </li>
              <li>
                Autonomous Painting Robots: These robots create abstract art by themselves, showing a lot of creativity and unpredictability. Watching a robot paint is a reminder of how unpredictable creativity can be. This unpredictability can lead to new styles and techniques that human artists might never have considered.
              </li>
              <li>
                Computational/AI Systems: These systems analyse and transform existing art, predict styles, and create new pieces. They have even beaten humans in games like Go and Poker, showing their potential in art. AI’s ability to understand and create art by analysing it is really interesting. It could change how we think about and make art. But this could have negative effects on the creative market if mishandled.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The goal is to make AI more sensitive to beauty and emotions, making it a better partner in creating art. This means balancing technical skills with a touch of human-like intuition. The notion of AI developing aesthetic sensitivity and empathy is both exciting and a bit daunting. It raises questions about the future of human-machine collaboration and the ethical implications of creating machines with a sense of artistic purpose.

            <h3>Internet Art</h3>
            <p>
              Internet art, or net art, uses the internet as both a tool and a theme, showing how connected our digital lives are. It’s always changing, often interactive, and deeply linked to the technology we use online. Internet art looks at things like connectivity, digital identity, and the temporary nature of online content. It often involves the audience in creating the art, blurring the lines between artist and viewer. This participatory approach mirrors social media and online platforms, making the art world more democratic and diverse. The interactive nature of internet art is very empowering. It lets anyone with internet access be part of the creative process, breaking down barriers to art. This could lead to a more inclusive and diverse art scene.

            <h3>UI/UX Design: Crafting Digital Experiences</h3>
            <p>
              User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design focus on making digital products easy and enjoyable to use. Good UI/UX design is about understanding what users need and want, ensuring that interfaces are functional, beautiful, and accessible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Key principles of UI/UX design are:
            </p>
            <p>
              User-Centered Design: This means putting users first, understanding their needs, and designing with them in mind. User-centered design shows the importance of empathy in tech. It helps create products that are not just functional but also meaningful and enjoyable. Consistency: Keeping things uniform across an application helps users learn and navigate it more easily. Consistency might seem minor, but it makes a big difference in user satisfaction. A consistent interface is easier to use and less frustrating. Accessibility: Design should be usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities. This includes things like colour contrast and keyboard navigation. Accessibility is both a moral and practical necessity. It ensures that tech serves all users, making the digital world more inclusive.
            </p>
            <p>
              Feedback and Responsiveness: Giving immediate feedback to user actions makes the interface feel responsive and interactive. Immediate feedback makes using digital products feel more natural and engaging, helping users feel in control. Simplicity and Clarity: Keeping things simple and clear helps users understand and use interfaces more easily. Simplicity is often hard to achieve, but it makes for a much better user experience. A clear, straightforward interface is more enjoyable to use. By following these principles, UI/UX designers create digital spaces that are not only functional but also delightful to use, making interactions smooth and satisfying.
            </p>
            <p>
              AI art, internet art, and UI/UX design are all pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with technology and creativity. AI art challenges our ideas about creativity, internet art changes how we engage with art online, and UI/UX design makes sure our digital interactions are smooth and enjoyable. These fields show how technology can transform artistic and design practices, promising a future full of creativity and innovation. Seeing how these fields evolve makes me hopeful for a future where tech and creativity work together seamlessly. As we move forward, focusing on empathy, inclusivity, and user-centered design will be key to making sure these advancements benefit everyone and create a richer, more human digital world.
